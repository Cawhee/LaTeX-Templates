#About
The following are templates designed for use with the LaTeX typesetting environment. I compile using pdflatex and have not tested any other method of compilation

#Explanations of the templates

##HistoryIA.tex
This template was designed for use in writing the International Baccalaureate's Internal Assessment. It contains the heading of the sections required in the paper along with a formatted title page. It has a space for a word count, however that you will have to manually fill as I do not have a package which counts the words and inserts them into that field. 

##Notes.tex
This is a note-taking template designed mainly for conferences / conventions however it can be deployed elsewhere as well. It uses the package "outlines" in order to create its bulleted and hyphenated lists. 

##PageDivider.tex
I like to keep my binders of notes organized. In order to do this effectively, I use section dividers. This is the template I have been using for section dividers over the past year.

##ReactionPaper.tex
I had to write a series of "Reaction Papers" over a book I had to read for class. This is just a basic setup for a report that I included my preferred method of doing block quotes in. 

##MLATemplate.tex
This is a simple template to set up a paper for MLA style. As such margins are set at 1 inch and parindents at .5in. This also includes a header with the command `\lastname`, so make sure you set that so that your name can be on every page in accordance with MLA style.
