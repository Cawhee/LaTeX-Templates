#About
The following are templates designed for use with the LaTeX typesetting environment. I compile using pdflatex and have not tested any other method of compilation
#Explanations of the templates
##HistoryIA.tex
This template was designed for use in writing the International Baccalaureate's Internal Assessment. It contains the heading of the sections required in the paper along with a formatted title page. It has a space for a word count, however that you will have to manually fill as I do not have a package which counts the words and inserts them into that field. 
##Notes.tex
This is a note-taking template designed mainly for conferences / conventions however it can be deployed elsewhere as well. It uses the package "outlines" in order to create its bulleted and hyphenated lists. 
##PageDivider.tex
I like to keep my binders of notes organized. In order to do this effectively, I use section dividers. This is the template I have been using for section dividers over the past year.
##ReactionPaper.tex
I had to write a series of "Reaction Papers" over a book I had to read for class. This is just a basic setup for a report that I included my preferred method of doing block quotes in. 
##MLA
There are two files in the MLA templates. The first is the MLATemplate.tex which is the key element of the template. This file need not be edited, other than setting your input file. 

MLABoilerplate is an example file. It contains the basics of the MLA header as an example of how you should format it.
