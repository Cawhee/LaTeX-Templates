#About
The following are templates designed for use with the LaTeX typesetting environment. I compile using pdflatex and have not tested any other method of compilation
#Explanations of the templates
##HistoryIA.tex
This template was designed for use in writing the International Baccalaureate's Internal Assessment. It contains the heading of the sections required in the paper along with a formatted title page. It has a space for a word count, however that you will have to manually fill as I do not have a package which counts the words and inserts them into that field. 
##Notes.tex
This is a note-taking template designed mainly for conferences / conventions however it can be deployed elsewhere as well. It uses the package "outlines" in order to create its bulleted and hyphenated lists.
